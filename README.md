# Launchpad
The web application for the M.S.L.E.S. project.

## Setup
1. Install Node.js on your system. Use the current LTS version (v16.17.0).
On macOS or Linux, I recommend [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#intro). On Windows just go to the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/).
2. In the root directory of this project, run `npm install`. This downloads and installs the dependencies for this project.
3. Finally, run `npm start`. This should open the React app in a new browser tab. Start editing!

I also added a linter for some basic static code checking. You can see if anything is wrong by running `npm run lint`.
